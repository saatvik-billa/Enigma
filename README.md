# Enigma
Completed during my Data Structures class at UC Berkeley during Spring 2022. 
Each student had to independently design the Enigma machine, the notorious machine 
created by the Germans and cracked by Alan Turing. We had to make use of various data structures 
and implement OOP in Java to emulate the machine.

Because of UC Berkeley course rules, we are not allowed to share this project publicly on github. 
However, if you would like to check it out, please email me at svik724@berkeley.edu and I will be 
more than happy to send it to you.

Thank you!
